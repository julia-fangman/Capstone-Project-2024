# Capstone-Project-2024

## Introduction to the Project: 
Recidivism, or the reoffense of criminal behavior after release from a prior sentence, is one of the major concerns of the US Justice System. As a method to both rehabilitate and deter criminal activity, punishment (typically in the form of prison sentences) is a fundamental practice in the US. However, if the system of justice fails to rehabilitate effectively, then the purpose of imprisonment is lost and the vast resources devoted to its cause are brought into question. Understanding the contributing variables that lead to recidivism can help to optimize and improve the means of enforcing the justice system, and promote a better society. Here, this study attempts to take recidivism data published by the National Institute of Justice and perform various exploratory analyses and modeling to better understand the factors that contribute to this issue.

### Setting Up the Project Environment
To create the virtual environment, run the following command:
python3 -m venv env 

To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:
source env/bin/activate 

To install the required dependencies for this project, execute the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Project Implementation: 

1. **Project Definition and Research**
   - Defined objectives: Understand factors influencing recidivism using data analysis.
   - Hypotheses: Investigate correlations between demographic factors and reoffense rates.

2. **Obtain Data (NACJD)**
   - Source: Retrieved dataset from NACJD containing recidivism records.
   - Structure: Detailed data dictionary and overview of dataset variables.
   - Preprocessing: Initial cleaning for missing values and data normalization.

3. **Clean and Process the Data**
   - Cleaning: Addressed missing values and outliers.
   - Transformation: Standardized variables and encoded categorical data.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistics**
   - EDA: Visualized distributions and correlations among variables.
   - Insights: Discovered trends in recidivism rates across different demographics.
   - Statistics: Calculated summary metrics.

5. **Advanced/Predictive Analysis (Feature Engineering/Model Development)**

6. **Model Evaluation with Interpretation, Insights, and Visualizations**
